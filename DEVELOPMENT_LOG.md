# Development Log

## Initial Setup - 2025-09-01

### What Was Built
Created a complete Android app foundation with modern architecture:

- **MVVM + Clean Architecture** - ViewModels, Controllers, Repository pattern
- **User Authentication** - Login/register with mock backend
- **Profile Management** - View/edit user profiles  
- **Navigation System** - Easy page navigation with Navigation Compose
- **State Management** - Reactive UI with StateFlow/SharedFlow
- **Dependency Injection** - Hilt for clean architecture

### Technical Stack
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
- Material 3 Design
- Navigation Compose  
- Hilt DI
- Coroutines for async operations
- Ready for Retrofit API integration

### Issues Resolved
1. **Dependency conflicts** - Removed duplicate navigation-compose-jvmstubs
2. **Version compatibility** - Updated Hilt and KSP versions for Kotlin 2.0.21
3. **Smart cast errors** - Fixed nullable state references in UI
4. **SDK version** - Updated to compileSdk 36 for latest dependencies

✅ Profile system functional  
✅ Navigation ready for new pages  
✅ Git repository with clean commits  

### Next Steps
Ready to add specific feature pages and business logic to this foundation.
